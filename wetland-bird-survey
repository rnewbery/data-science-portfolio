# Wetland Bird Survey Dashboard – RSPB Pulborough Brooks (August 2025)

This repository contains a complete workflow for analysing wetland bird observations collected during a timed vantage-point survey at **RSPB Pulborough Brooks** on **24 August 2025**.  
The project demonstrates ecological data processing, biodiversity metric calculation, pivot-table summarisation, and interactive dashboard creation using **Google Sheets / Excel**.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to transform raw field observations into a clear, visually structured dashboard.  
Key ecological questions addressed:

**1. How does species abundance differ between habitat types?**  
**2. Which habitats support highest biodiversity (species richness & Shannon Diversity H’)?**  
**3. Which species are most abundant within wetland habitats?**  
**4. What behaviours were observed during the survey?**  
**5. What proportion of detections were visual vs acoustic?**

## 📊 Dashboard Outputs

The final dashboard includes:

### **Habitat-Level Metrics**
- Total Abundance per Habitat  
- Species Richness per Habitat  
- Shannon Diversity Index (H’)  
- Shannon Diversity (H’) Visual Only  

### **Wetland-Specific Outputs**
- Wetland Bird Species Richness  
- Most Abundant Wetland Species (Visual Records Only)  
- Wetland Behaviour Frequencies  

### **Detection Type Breakdown**
- Percentage of Visual vs Acoustic Records  

### **Environmental Summary**
- Temperature  
- Wind Speed / Direction  
- Weather  
- Habitat Descriptions  
- Start Times for Each Vantage Point  

All visualisations were created using pivot tables and Google Sheets charts.

## Data Processing Steps

1. Imported raw field notes into Google Sheets  
2. Cleaned species names and standardised categorical fields  
3. Added a **“Wetland Species (Yes/No)”** classification field  
4. Filtered out acoustic detections for abundance-based charts  
5. Generated pivot tables for counts, richness, and behaviour  
6. Computed biodiversity metrics:  
   - **Species Richness per Habitat**  
   - **Total Abundance**  
   - **Shannon Diversity Index (H’)**  
7. Created a structured dashboard with consistent formatting
