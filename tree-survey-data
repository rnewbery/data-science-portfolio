# Tree Survey Summary

This project analyses data collected from a small-scale tree survey to explore relationships between tree species, height, canopy cover, and site conditions.  
The script processes raw survey data, calculates summary statistics, and produces basic visual outputs to support ecological reporting and habitat assessments.

## Project Purpose

This project was designed to apply data handling and analysis techniques to real-world ecological field data.  
It demonstrates how Python can be used to automate data summaries, explore relationships between variables, and visualise environmental datasets.
