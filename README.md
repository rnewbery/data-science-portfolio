# Rae Newbery – Data Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio contains applied projects combining data analysis, ecology, and research communication.  
It highlights analytical and visual projects developed using **R, Python, and Power BI** - each grounded in real or simulated ecological data.

## Featured Projects

- [**Western Kingbird Analysis**](./western-kingbird-analysis)  
  Statistical comparison of morphometric traits across populations using R.  
  *Skills:* GLM, ANOVA, data visualisation, reproducible workflows.

- [**Garden Birdwatch Summary**](./garden-birdwatch-summary)  
  Python script automating the categorisation and summary of bird survey data.  
  *Skills:* Python scripting, data categorisation, text file output, Git versioning.

- [**Tree Survey Data Analysis**](./tree-survey-data)  
  Exploratory analysis of tree species, canopy cover, and site conditions.  
  *Skills:* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), ecological data summaries, visual reporting.

- [**Wetland Bird Trends Analysis**] – *Coming soon*  
  Seasonal abundance and distribution modelling in R.

- [**Biodiversity Dashboard (Power BI)**] – *Coming soon*  
  Interactive visualisation of habitat data and survey metrics.

## About

I’m currently completing an **MSc in Wildlife Biology & Conservation** while developing analytical projects that blend ecological field data with data science tools.  
My work bridges conservation and analytics — from species survey data in R and Python to dashboards that communicate biodiversity insights clearly and accessibly.
